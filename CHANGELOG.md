## [Unreleased]

-### Added
- `run` command: execute arbitrary `bench` commands inside a bench aliasâ€™s frappe container
- Support for real-time streaming of bench command output (via Docker exec API)
- `status` command: report `offline` if container not running; `online` if container running; `running` only when HTTP probe succeeds (exit code=0 & non-000 HTTP code)
- Enhanced `--verbose`/`-v` option for `status` to show the curl command, exit code, raw output, and explanation of the reported status
- Global `--bench`/`-b` option for targeting a bench alias across commands (no project name needed when alias is unique)
- `list-apps` command: new subcommand to display apps for a bench alias
- `config bench alias` and `config bench unalias` commands to assign or clear aliases for bench instances by project and bench path

-### Changed
- `run` subcommand now streams the underlying bench process output in real time instead of buffering until completion
- Default `list-apps` output is now a table of App | Version | Branch | Sites
- Added `--quiet`/`-q` flag to `list-apps` for name-only output suitable for scripting
- Persist interactive aliases immediately to cache in `inspect --interactive`
- Renamed `AvailableApp` table to `available_apps`; renamed join model to `installed_apps` for clarity
- Introduced `InstalledAppDetail` (`installed_apps` table) to store per-site app version and branch

## [0.3.2] - 2025-08-03

### Added

- Interactive bench naming support for `cwcli inspect` (via `--interactive`, `-i`)
