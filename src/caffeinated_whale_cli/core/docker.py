"""Core Docker accessors: resolve a container, raise typed errors, leak nothing.

The frappe container object stays INTERNAL to the core function that execs into
it - it is never placed in a DTO returned across a ``core.<verb>`` boundary. The
CLI-facing ``docker_utils.get_frappe_container`` is re-expressed as a thin
wrapper over :func:`get_frappe_container` here, so there is one resolution
implementation and the CLI's message/exit behavior is preserved.

The UI-free Docker primitives (:func:`get_project_containers`,
:func:`get_project_volumes`, :func:`utf8_stream_decoder`) live HERE rather than
in ``utils/docker_utils.py`` so the core never imports that module - which pulls
``typer``/``rich`` at load time for its CLI error helpers. Keeping them in the
core makes the UI-purity ban transitively true, not just directly true.

    Docker frames an exec socket at 32KB and ``bench`` (CPython, talking to a pipe)
    flushes in 8KB blocks, so a chunk boundary lands at an arbitrary BYTE offset -
    routinely mid-character, since Frappe emits unicode (``✓ ✗ → ─ │ └ ⚠ ✅``)
    routinely. Decoding a chunk in isolation is therefore wrong: strict decoding
    raises on the split, and ``errors="replace"`` corrupts the character to U+FFFD.
    One incremental decoder held across the whole stream buffers those leftover
    bytes until the next chunk completes the character.

    ``replace`` still applies to input that is genuinely not UTF-8 - streaming
    another program's output must never kill the CLI - but a mere split is no
    longer mistaken for invalid input.

    Each stream needs its OWN decoder: a demuxed exec (``init``) must not feed
    stderr's bytes into stdout's pending character.
